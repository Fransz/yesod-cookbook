These haven't actually been formally discussed yet. Just Greg Weber's brainstorm.

# Better client side tools

1.0 is a great server-side framework. We have the basics for help with the client side with widgets and support for organizing and minifying javascript/css, but we need to take this further.

* technique for combining & minimizing static assets. We do this for your js/css templates, but not for existing static files.
* integration with responsive design principles. We are already getting some integration with Bootstrap, it seems like a decent default. Have the ability to automatically serve properly sized images (maybe pre-cache different sizes, maybe cache different sizes after generating them). If we go the Bootstrap route we probably need integration with LESS
* wai-sockjs for a backwards-compatible, high-level websockets interface.
* integration with Javascript. This could mean writing JS in Haskell. It could mean automatically generating backbone.js model code, automatically updating view code with knockout.js, or FRP JS code with flapjax.

# Better Persistent

* Simple & safe raw query support.

# More Extensibility

* Yesod middleware
* A more official library/plugin API
* Any other ideas?

# Easy deployment
