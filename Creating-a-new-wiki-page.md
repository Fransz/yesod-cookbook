# Creating a new wiki page

* create a link to the new page from an existing page. 

Wiki links are links with a /wiki prefix

* view the existing page and click on the link you created

Now you are on your new page.

You are tasked with choosing the format of your new page. Markdown is nice for having control, particularly with respect to code samples. However, our HTML editor is a really nice WYSIWYG editor that uses contentEditable (aloha editor).
