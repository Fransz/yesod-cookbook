Scratch what I said previously, I was mistaken. Currently (through version 1.3), Persistent uses `WITHOUT TIME ZONE` to store `UTCTime`. This is based on a mistaken understanding, and the problem will be addressed in version 2.0 (see [the roadmap](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/wiki/Persistent-2.0-goals#wiki-change-handling-of-utctime-in-postgresql)). In the meanwhile, you can:

1. Use `ZonedTime` to force the database to use `WITH TIME ZONE`.
2. Continue to use `UTCTime` with the understanding that the value stored in the database is in the UTC timezone. During the 2.0 upgrade process, we'll provide migration information as necessary.
