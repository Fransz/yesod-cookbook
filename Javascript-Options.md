Yesod by default gives you Shakespeare-Javascript, also known as Julius. It is just Javascript that you can insert haskell values into. Also Shakespeare-Coffee, which is Coffeescript you can insert haskell values into. Coffeescript is a thin veneer that papers over Javascript to make a convenient and consistent language, but there is still no type system.

There is prior art for Julius: [jmacro](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/jmacro-0.5.1) has QQ value insertion, but also supports a haskell-ish version of javascript.

We are hoping someone will figure out a satisfactory way to have strongly typed Javascript. Here are the options:

## Compile Haskell

* [UHC js compiler](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_JavaScript_Problem#UHC)
* [ghcjs](https://github.com/pedromartins/ghcjs) - [example Yesod app](https://github.com/hamishmack/yesod-slides) - directly compile ghc code to javascript!
* [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) â€” compiles LLVM/Clang output to JavaScript. If you use features of the GHC runtime you also have to compile it, which nobody has made an effort to figure out.

## A Haskell-like language that only compiles to Javascript

* [Roy](http://roy.brianmckenna.org/)
* [lambdascript](https://github.com/valderman/lambdascript)

## Haskell code that explicitly generates Javascript

* [Panther-Ajax](http://osdir.com/ml/general/2011-06/msg41431.html) Experimental library to write server side code that accesses the dom and uses continuations.
* [Ji](https://github.com/chrisdone/ji) - experimental library not currently working with Yesod. Same as Panther-Ajax, but under active development.
* [HJScript](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HJScript-0.5.0) - javascript DSL.

## Add strong-typing to Coffeescript

[Uberscript](https://github.com/jstrachan/coffee-script/blob/master/TypeAnnotations.md) requires Google Closure compiler for its type-checking. A great idea, but this is a fork of coffeescript that has now fallen behind coffeescript by almost a year.

## Other strongly typed languages that compile to Javascript

* [Ur/Web](http://impredicative.com/ur/demo/) - A Haskell-like programming language tailored to web programming. Automatically generates FRP javascript code. Apropriate for taking the FRP plunge, but Heavyweight (large library and difficult to debug) if you just want some strongly-typed JS. [Opa](opalang.org) is a very similar concept.
