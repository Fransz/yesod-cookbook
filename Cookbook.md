# The Yesod Cookbook

The Yesod Cookbook contains small snippets of code for solving practical problems with Yesod. If you have some code to share, please create a wiki page and link to it in the appropriate section.

If you're looking for a comprehensive guide to learning Yesod, please consider [reading the book](http://www.yesodweb.com/book).

For non-Yesod code, see also [Snippets|Snippets].
