# About

This tutorial is a project to make a small, beginner level, tutorial to teach how to use the Yesod Web Framework. I started to write it as a beginner with starter-level knowledge on Haskell and Yesod. I have a non-professional Ruby background and I learned some Ruby on Rails with this excellent tutorial: [Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) written by Michael Hartl.

To gain experience in the Yesod Web Framework and because Yesod misses a beginner level tutorial (my opinion), I started to *translate* the Ruby on Rails Tutorial to Yesod. It is not meant to explain every technical detail about Yesod and Haskell. I hope it allows starters to find answers to the same *simple* problems I had with my first steps with Yesod.

Because of my basic knowledge of Haskell and Yesod, and English not being my mother tongue, please, don't hesitate to improve this tutorial.
